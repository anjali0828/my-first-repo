        <h1 class="desc"> Travel can be done by foot, bicycle, automobile, train, boat, bus, airplane, ship or other means,
             with or without luggage, and can be one way or round trip. Travel can also include relatively 
             short stays between successive movements, as in the case of tourism.
             Travelling may mean many things for many people. If we open up dictionaries, they give
             many meanings of travelling. Someone may be on a trip or journey. For another group,
             travelling may mean going from one place to another as a travel agent, salesman, for business
             purpose, or studies. Light also travels from one object to another. Again, in some games like
             basketball, breaking a certain rule may mean travelling.
